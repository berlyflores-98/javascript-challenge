week 14 HW

The purpose of this repository is a way to be able to display and filter through UFO appearances using Javascript, HTML and CSS. The date range of information is from 1/1/2010 to 1/13/2010. 

The first gif below is an example of the UFO- Level 1 exercise. As you can see, you are able to filter by dates. If you wish to view all of the data, then select Filter Table. If you wish to see for any date between 1/1/2010 and 1/13/2010, then enter the date and click Filter Table.
